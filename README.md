# Chumming

Chumming is a process where people are typically don't know each other well are paired to create a more close-knit community. You can use chumming to help on-board new hires/members, increase a feeling of community, etc. This application will help you set up chumming for your organization.

In order to use the application, first go to setup.ipynb and follow the instructions there. Next, go to chumming.ipynb, run all of the cells, and check out.csv to see the pairings for this session. Repeat for every new session of chumming.

Feel free to send me a message @ ron.thalanki@gmail.com if you have any recommendations for improvement or see any bugs.
